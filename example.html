          <p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming,
and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>

    <P>Two major versions of Python are currently in active use:</p>

    <li>Python 3.x is the current version and is under active development.</li>
    <li>Python 2.x is the legacy version and will receive only security updates until 2020. No new features will be
implemented. Note that many projects still use Python 2, although migrating to Python 3 is getting easier.</li>

        <article>
          <li> Python is a dynamic-typed language; you don’t have to explicitly state that a variable is an integer number, for example. The Python interpreter will figure that out:</li>

          <li>Python is interpreted, meaning it is ran “on-the-fly”. This makes it very easy to write and test programs. Many other languages are compiled to machine code before they will run; this makes them run faster than Python, but for most things you won’t notice it.</li>
          <li>Python allows you to use procedural programming (via functions) or object-oriented programming (via classes). Some other languages make you use one or the other.</li>
    <li>Python has built-in data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, so you don’t have to create these structures from scratch. It also handles memory management for you.</li>

        <article>
        <p>You can download and install either version of Python here. See Python 3 vs. Python 2 for a comparison between them. In addition, some third-parties offer re-packaged versions of Python that add commonly used libraries and
other features to ease setup for common use cases, such as math, data analysis or scientific use</p>

    <p> To confirm that Python was installed correctly, you can verify that by running the following command in your favorite terminal (If you are using Windows OS, you need to add path of python to the environment variable before
using it in command prompt):</p>


         <li> $ python --version</>
         <li>Python 3.x Version ≥ 3.0</li>
    <p>If you have Python 3 installed, and it is your default version (see Troubleshooting for more details) you should see something like this:</p>
    <li> $ python --version</>
    <li>Python 3.6.0</li>
    <li>Python 2.x Version ≤ 2.7</li>
    <p>If you have Python 2 installed, and it is your default version (see Troubleshooting for more details) you should see something like this:</p>
    <li>$ python --version</li>
    <li>Python 2.7.13</li>
    <p>If you have installed Python 3, but $ python --version outputs a Python 2 version, you also have Python 2 installed. This is often the case on MacOS, and many Linux distributions. Use $ python3 instead to explicitly use the
Python 3 interpreter.</p>

<p>It will open a shell with options along the top</p>

    <code> >>></code>
    <p>Now write the following code in the prompt:</p>

        <p>Hit Enter.</p>
        <code>>>> print("Hello, World")
 Hello, World</code>

      <section class="main-section" id=" Creating_variables_and_assigning_values">
        <header> Creating variables and assigning values</header>
        <p>To create a variable in Python, all you need to do is specify the variable name, and then assign a value to it.</p>
        
           <code> < variable name> = < value></code>
            
        <p>Python uses = to assign values to variables. There's no need to declare a variable in advance (or to assign a data type to it), assigning a value to a variable itself declares and initializes the variable with that value. There's no way to declare a variable without assigning it an initial value.
         </p>
         <code>declare a variable without assigning it an initial value.
                # Integer
                a = 2
                print(a)
                # Output: 2
                # Integer
                b = 9223372036854775807
                print(b)
                # Output: 9223372036854775807
                # Floating point
                pi = 3.14
                print(pi)
                # Output: 3.14
                # String
                c = 'A'
                print(c)

                # Empty value or null data type
                x = None
                print(x)
                # Output: Noneaz</code>
    <p>Variable assignment works from left to right. So the following will give you an syntax error.</p>
    <code>0 = x
 => Output: SyntaxError: can't assign to literal </code>
 <p>You can not use python's keywords as a valid variable name. You can see the list of keyword by</p>
 <code>import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist) </code>
<header>Rules for variable naming:</header>
<p>1. Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore.</p>
<code>x = True # valid
_y = True # valid
9x = False # starts with numeral
=> SyntaxError: invalid syntax
 $y = False # starts with symbol
=> SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code>
<p>2. The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores.</p>
<code>has_0_in_it = "Still Valid"</code>
<p>3. Names are case sensitive.</p>
<code>x = 9
y = X*5
=>NameError: name 'X' is not defined
  </code>
  <p>Even though there's no need to specify a data type when declaring a variable in Python, while allocating the
    necessary area in memory for the variable, the Python interpreter automatically picks the most suitable built-in
    type for it:</p>
    <code>a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
      print(a, b, c)
      # Output: 1 2 3
      a, b, c = 1, 2
      => Traceback (most recent call last):
      => File "name.py", line N, in <module>
      => a, b, c = 1, 2
      => ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack
      a, b = 1, 2, 3
      => Traceback (most recent call last):
      => File "name.py", line N, in <module>
      => a, b = 1, 2, 3
      => ValueError: too many values to unpack</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Block_Indentation">
        <header>Block Indentation</header>
        <article>
    
          <p>Python uses indentation to define control and loop constructs. This contributes to Python's readability, however, it
            requires the programmer to pay close attention to the use of whitespace. Thus, editor miscalibration could result in
            code that behaves in unexpected ways</p>
          <p>Python uses the colon symbol (:) and indentation for showing where blocks of code begin and end (If you come
            from another language, do not confuse this with somehow being related to the ternary operator). That is, blocks in
            Python, such as functions, loops, if clauses and other constructs, have no ending identifiers. All blocks start with a
            colon and then contain the indented lines below it</p>

          <p>For example:</p>
          <code>def my_function(): # This is a function definition. Note the colon (:)
        a = 2             # This line belongs to the function because it's indented
        return a          # This line also belongs to the same function
        print(my_function()) # This line is OUTSIDE the function block
        or
        if a > b:          # If block starts here
        print(a)           # This is part of the if block
        else:              # else must be at the same level as if
        print(b)           # This line is part of the else block</code>
        <p>Blocks that contain exactly one single-line statement may be put on the same line, though this form is generally not considered good style:
          </p>
        <code>if a > b: print(a)
  else: print(b) </code>
  <p>Attempting to do this with more than a single statement will not work</p>
  <code>if x > y: y = x
  print(y) # IndentationError: unexpected indent
  if x > y: while y != z: y -= 1 # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   </code>
   <p>An empty block causes an IndentationError. Use pass (a command that does nothing) when you have a block with
    no content:</p>
    <code>def will_be_implemented_later():
  pass</code>

         <header>Booleans</header>
     Data types are nothing but variables you use to reserve some space in memory. Python variables do not need an
explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a
variable.
    <p>bool: A boolean value of either True or False. Logical operations like and, or, not can be performed on booleans.</p>
     <code>x or y # if x is False then y otherwise x
  x and y # if x is False then x otherwise y
  not x # if x is True then False, otherwise True</code>
          <p><In Python 2.x and in Python 3.x, a boolean is also an int. The bool type is a subclass of the int type and True and
            False are its only instances:/p>

    <code>  issubclass(bool, int) # True
  isinstance(True, bool) # True
  isinstance(False, bool) # True</code>
  <p>If boolean values are used in arithmetic operations, their integer values (1 and 0 for True and False) will be used to
  return an integer result:></p>
<code>True + False == 1 # 1 + 0 == 1
True * True == 1 # 1 * 1 == 1</code>
